# arch1-binary-tree

This directory contains:
* code that implements a binary tree of strings 
* a demo program that uses it

The program reads lines from stdin.
Each line is appended onto a binary tree.
After end-of-file is read, the lines are printed out.

This lab contains the following files:
 addEmployee.h: insertion of names into system.
 deleteEmployee.h: removal of names in program.
 listAllEMployees.h: a display of all names in tree.
 PMS.c: main program to execute the interface and method calls.
